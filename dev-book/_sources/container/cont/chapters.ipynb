    "# Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, containers have revolutionized the way we develop, deploy, and manage applications. Their popularity is no accident; they offer a level of efficiency and consistency that traditional virtual machines (VMs) and other deployment methods haven’t been able to compare to. In this chapter, we will go through the essentials of using containers effectively. We’ll also dive into an alternative to Docker: Podman.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of containers as little packages of software that are shared and deployed. Containers are a lightweight form of virtualization that package an application and its dependencies into a single, portable unit. Unlike VMs, which include an entire operating system, containers share the host OS's kernel but maintain isolated user spaces. This means they are more efficient and faster to start up, making them way more scalable and accessible. They can also be started both locally, and in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Containers?\n",
    "Why do we use containers? Well, have you ever had code run on your computer that doesn’t run on someone else’s? Or have you ever been caught in dependency hell, where you’re trying to upgrade and downgrade your packages, just so you can just run your code? Software is constantly being worked on, and the time when you download it or what version you decide to download has a lot to do with the functionality and features of that software. And someone else who might have downloaded that package may have a different level of functionality, or they may not have that package at all! So, to keep everything consistent for everyone using it, we use containers.\n"

    "1. Consistency Across Environments: Containers ensure that your application behaves the same way regardless of where it's deployed. This eliminates the “works on my machine” problem by providing a consistent environment throughout the development process\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Isolation and Security: Containers run in isolated environments, which means different containers can run different applications or versions of an application without conflicts. This isolation also enhances security by limiting the scope of potential breaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resource Efficiency: Containers are lightweight compared to VMs because they share the host OS's resources. This efficiency allows you to run more containers on the same hardware, making them super resource efficient!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Portability: Containers can run on any system that supports container technology, making it easy to move applications between different environments, whether it's from a developer’s laptop to a staging environment or from on-premises hardware to the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise: Getting Started with Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with containers, you'll need to familiarize yourself with some key tools and concepts. The most widely used container technology is Docker, though there are other options like Podman. Here's a basic guide to using Docker and Podman.\n"

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Understanding Docker Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The first component we’ll cover is a docker image. You can think of docker images like a blueprint for the container. They are read-only templates that contain instructions for creating a container. The second component we can go over is the container itself, in formal terms they are docker images running as isolated processes. But you can think of them as literal containers filled with software that you can enter. Docker hub is a public registry where you can find and share Docker images, almost like Github, like being a public registry where you can find code. But there are lots of other places where you can find docker images, like Amazon ECR or Red Hat’s Quay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s try running our first container!\n",
    "\n",
    " Once Docker is installed, you can run your first container. Open your terminal run the following command to run a simple container using the official `hello-world` image:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```docker run hello-world```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command pulls the `hello-world` image from Docker Hub (if it's not already downloaded) and runs it in a container. You will see a message confirming that Docker is installed and working correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create a docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build your own Docker images, you'll use a Dockerfile—a text file with instructions on how to build an image. Here’s a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "First make a folder called flask-app\n",
    "Flask is a popular package for developing websites\n",
    "Inside flask app create a file called app.py\n",
    "In app.py, include this code, for our flask web-app:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    return 'Congrats, you built a container!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then create a file called Dockerfile in the same folder, the comments contain instructions explaining Dockerfile commands\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#from gives us a base image to work with, it helps identify some of the underlying architecture we want to create our container with\n",
    "#you don't have to use from, but it's often easier for beginners to use a base image that exists\n",
    "#we also tend to use slimmed images for space efficiency, as you can see here\n",

    "\n",

    "#it's necessary for a lot of other commands like RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT\n",
    "#we'll learn about those later\n",

    "3. Manage Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "   Docker provides some commands to help you manage containers, let’s go over some of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - List Containers: `docker ps` shows running containers. Use `docker ps -a` to see all containers, including stopped ones.\n",
    "   - Stop a Container: `docker stop <container_id>` stops a running container\n",
    "   - Remove a Container: `docker rm <container_id>` removes a stopped container\n",
    "   - View Logs: `docker logs <container_id>` displays the logs from a container\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing Podman\n",
    "\n",
    "Podman is an open-source container management tool that provides a Docker-compatible experience while offering additional features and capabilities. It is often praised for its focus on security and its daemonless architecture. Here’s how Podman compares to Docker and how you can get started with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installing Podman\n",
    "\n",
    "Podman can be installed on various Linux distributions and is available for Windows and macOS. Installation instructions for different platforms can be found on the [Podman installation page](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Podman with:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   sudo apt update\n",
    "   sudo apt install podman\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Podman vs. Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Daemonless Architecture: Unlike Docker, which relies on a long-running daemon, Podman runs as a single binary and uses a client-server architecture. This makes it more compatible with systemd and enhances security.\n",
    "   - Rootless Containers: Podman supports rootless containers, which can run without requiring root privileges, thus improving security and reducing risks.\n",
    "   - Docker Compatibility: Podman aims to be compatible with Docker CLI commands, which means you can often use Podman as a drop-in replacement for Docker commands. So, `podman run` works similarly to `docker run`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Running Containers with Podman\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here’s how you can run a container using Podman, starting with the `hello-world` image:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   podman run hello-world\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Podman also uses Dockerfiles for building images. To build and run a container, you can use similar commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   podman build -t flask-app .\n",
    "   podman run -p 4000:8000 flask-app\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Managing Containers with Podman\n",
    "\n",
    "   Podman provides commands that manage containers:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - List Containers: `podman ps` shows running containers. Use `podman ps -a` to see all containers and their ids\n",
    "   - Stop a Container: `podman stop <container_id>` stops a running container\n",
    "   - Remove a Container: `podman rm <container_id>` removes a stopped container\n",
    "   - View Logs: `podman logs <container_id>` displays the logs from a container\n",
    "\n",
    "Looks pretty similar, huh?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Container Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Minimal Base Images: Start with the smallest base image, many docker images are made smaller and stripped so they’re more space efficient\n",
    "2. Keep Images Up-to-Date: Regularly update your images to include the latest security patches and improvements\n",
    "3. Limit Container Privileges: Run containers with the least amount of privilege necessary to mitigate security risks\n",
    "4. Monitor and Log: Implement monitoring and logging solutions to keep track of container performance and troubleshoot issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers, whether managed with Docker or Podman, have become essential to modern application development, giving engineers unmatched portability, efficiency, and consistency. By understanding the basics of these tools and how to manage containers effectively, you can make the stuff you build more accessible to a wider number of users, and never run into the, “well, it worked on my machine”, again!\n",
