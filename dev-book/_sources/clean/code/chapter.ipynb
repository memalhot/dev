    "# Chapter 3: Clean Code - The Secret to Happy Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the essential guide to clean coding standards. Writing clean code is not just about making your code work; it’s about making it understandable, maintainable, and efficient. This chapter will cover the core principles and practices that will help you write clean and professional code. New programmers are often exposed to the new skill of reading and debugging code that isn’t their own, and writing cleaner code helps developers work better together.\n",
    "\n",
    "In school, you often write singular functions, avoiding many functions that work together or definining functions yourself. It is important that before you start writing code, to make sure you sit down and plan out how to break down the problems you're dealing with into smaller problems that can be defined as functions. But once you're done planning, here are some good rules to follow while writing code in a proffessional or open source setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming Conventions aka The Art of Naming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables should be named in a way that clearly describes their purpose. Avoid vague or generic names. For example, use `totalAmount` instead of `t` or `temp`. Descriptive names enhance readability and make your code easier to understand. Try to step out of yourself and see if a stranger could understand it!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Function names should clearly convey their purpose. A function named `calculateTotalAmount()` is much more informative than one named `doTask()`. Functions should perform a single, well-defined action. (Pro tip: single and well defined is a good rule of thumb when planning your code). This not only makes them easier to test but also simplifies debugging and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Responsibility Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "A function should do one thing and do it well. If a function is doing too much, consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused functions. This makes your code more modular and easier to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Length\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep functions short. Long functions can be difficult to understand and maintain. Aim to keep functions within a screen’s length so that they can be viewed without scrolling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Responsibility Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like functions, classes should have a single responsibility. They should encapsulate related data and methods that operate on that data. Avoid turning a class into a \"god object\" that does everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cohesion\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that all parts of a class are related to its primary purpose. High cohesion within a class means that its methods and variables are closely related, making the class easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments and Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purposeful Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Use comments to explain why something is done, not what is done. Well-written code should be self-explanatory, but comments can provide context or rationale behind complex logic. Avoid redundant comments that state the obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain clear and concise documentation for your codebase. This includes inline comments, function and class descriptions, and external documentation. Good documentation helps others (and your future self) understand and use your code effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Style Guides\n",
    "\n",
    "Adhere to a consistent style guide throughout your codebase. This includes naming conventions, indentation, spacing, and other formatting rules. Consistency makes your code more predictable and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linting\n",
    "\n",
    "Use linters to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues early. Linters can automatically check for adherence to style guides and highlight common errors, improving overall code quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying and Avoiding Code Smells\n",
    "\n",
    "### Duplicated Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid code duplication by refactoring common logic into functions or classes. Duplicated code increases the risk of bugs and makes maintenance harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long Parameter Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Long parameter lists can be confusing and error-prone. Use objects or structures to group related parameters, simplifying function signatures and making calls more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magic Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid using hard-coded numbers in your code. Instead, use named constants to give meaningful context. For example, replace `365` with `DAYS_IN_YEAR` to clarify its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Refactoring involves improving the structure and readability of your code without changing its behavior. Regularly refactor your code to remove redundancies, improve clarity, and optimize performance. This practice helps keep your codebase clean and maintainable over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is crucial for ensuring code reliability. Write unit tests to verify individual functions and integration tests to ensure that different parts of your system work together correctly. Automated tests can catch errors early, reducing the risk of bugs in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Test Focus\n",
    "Some things to focus on when testing when dealing with inputs and outputs could be if data is  empty or null, invalid inputs, or outputs that are too large, too small, or have special characters. Try thinking like a user who often makes mistakes! Does double clicking on a button duplicate an entry in a database? If you do actions on your product not in the order they’re usually done, does it change the outcome? Try to break your code when you test!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim for high test coverage, but prioritize critical paths and core functionalities. Comprehensive testing increases confidence in your code and simplifies future changes and refactoring. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some example tests for a Java class called BigInt:\n",
