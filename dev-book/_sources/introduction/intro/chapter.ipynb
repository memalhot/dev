    "In the dynamic world of software development, learning important skills beyond the realms of algorithms and data structures is crucial. This book is for graduates or students who have some background programming, but may have a skill gap between the theory they learned in school and some areas of professional development. This book's goal is to help close that skill gap.\n",

    "This book is apart of the Open Education Project, or OPE, is a project started by the Red Hat Research. The project provides an framework for a more open source education, with a containerized lab environment for students to get hands on experience, or This textbook is a small example of it's guiding philosophy, it's technology leverages open source at every level- from the data centers it uses to the content of it's textbooks.

    "The goal of this textbook is not to be a convententional textbook, it aims to be readable, use direct and clear language, and guide you directly with examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each chapter is covers a different area of knowledge that prepares you for a professional development environment. Through case studies and interviews with seasoned software engineers, you'll gain invaluable perspectives and learn from their experiences in the field. This blend of theory and practice equips you with the tools and mindset needed to thrive in today's fast-paced software development landscape.\n",
