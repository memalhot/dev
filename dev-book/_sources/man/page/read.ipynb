Say you want to delete a directory without having to confirm if it's ok with your system ( which can get tedious, albeit a little unsafe... ), instead of just using `rm`, you would use `rm -rf`, with the -r standing for recursive and -f standing for with force (no annoying asking!). This option lets you use the command in a more useful and custom way. Another example of this you may have seen is `ls -la` list all the hidden files in a directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Optional Arguments**  \n",
    "When an argument is optional, it's usually enclosed in square brackets. And sometimes there might be multiple optional arguments, and each will have their own set of square brackets.  \n",

    "Let's look at an example, using the command ping, that tests the reachability of a host: \n",

    "**Mutually Exclusive Arguments**\n",
    "Some argument's can't operate at the same time. You have to choose one option, rather than both. This means that they are mutually exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Curly braces show that the arguments are mutually exclusive. Multiple mutually exclusive options can be separated by a pipe (|).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example, you can choose either `--silent` or `--verbose`, because the two options are conflicting:\n",

    "```\n",
    "{--silent|--verbose}\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Arguments That Can Repeat**  \n",
    "Use three dots (...) without spaces (an ellipsis) to indicate that an argument can be repeated multiple times.  \n",

    "**Uppercase vs Lowercase**\n",
    "A reminder that options are case sensitive!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short Options vs Long Options**\n",
    "Single-letter options that are preceded by a minus sign (-). The case of the letter is important, as different options have different effects. For example, -e and -E are different options. These are referred to as short options. Long options are made up of two hyphens followed by one or more lowercase alphanumeric words. Hyphens separate the words. So, rather than dealing with letters which can get cryptic and confusing, you have the option to have a longer but more clear option.\n",

    "\"A flag is a type of option, an option of boolean type, and is always false by default (e.g. --verbose, --quiet, --all, --long, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "An option tells the function how to act (e.g. -a, -l, --verbose, --output , -name , -c , etc), whist an arguments tells the function what to act on/from (e.g. *, file1, hostname, database).\"\n",
