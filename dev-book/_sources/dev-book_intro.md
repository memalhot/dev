# Beyond the Classroom: A Practical Guide to Software Engineering

Welcome to Beyond the Classroom: A Practical Guide to Software Engineering. 

This is an online open source textbook using a tool started by the Open Education project (OPE), a collaboration between Boston University and Red Hat Research. The intention of this book is to help people adjust from academia to professional software development environments. Think of it as a missing semester of your college education. The ideal audience of this book are graduates and students or anyone with a programming background, aiming to bridge the gap between academic theory understanding and the demands of professional practice. This textbook also aims to share insights from engineers, focusing on skill gaps and dealing with imposter syndrome as a young engineer.
