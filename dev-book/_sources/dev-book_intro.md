# Beyond the Classroom: A Practical Guide to Software Engineering

Welcome to Beyond the Classroom: A Practical Guide to Software Engineering. 

This is an online open source textbook using a tool started by the *Open Education Project* (OPE), a collaboration between Boston University and Red Hat Research. Think of it as the semester of your college education you never knew you needed. The ideal audience for this book is recent graduates and current students, or anyone with a programming background. This book aims to help people adjust from academia to professional software development environments by bridging the gap between academic theory and the demands of professional practice. It also shares insights from actual engineers, with a focus on skill gaps and imposter syndrome, a familiar feeling for many young engineers.
